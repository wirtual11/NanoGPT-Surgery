NanoGPT-Surgery: From-Scratch Implementation &amp; Weight Transfusion 🔬

#Project Overview
This repository contains a "from-scratch" implementation of the GPT-2 architecture using PyTorch and Python. The primary goal of this project is to bridge the gap between high-level library usage and low-level architectural understanding.

Unlike standard tutorials that use AutoModel.from_pretrained, this project involves writing the Multi-Head Causal Attention, Feed-Forward Blocks, and Layer Normalization from the ground up, then manually mapping weights from the Hugging Face gpt2 checkpoint into the custom-built tensors.
